## Executive Summary

This project implements and evaluates multiple classification algorithms on two healthcare datasets: heart disease (918 patients) and diabetes (99,805 patients). The work demonstrates systematic preprocessing, comprehensive classifier comparison, and feature selection impact analysis.

**Key Results:**
- Heart Disease: 86.07% accuracy (Random Forest)
- Diabetes: 87.46% accuracy (Support Vector Machine)
- Feature Selection: 88.05% accuracy with only 7 of 16 features
- Computational Optimization: 4-6x speedup through parallel processing

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Objectives

This project addresses three core machine learning concepts:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Transform numerical features into categorical representations using clinically relevant thresholds
2. **Classifier Comparison**: Evaluate Decision Trees, Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines
3. **Feature Selection**: Analyze how feature subset size affects classification performance

### 1.2 Datasets

**Heart Disease Dataset** (heart-disease-classification.csv)
- 918 patients with 11 features (mixed categorical and numerical)
- Binary target: heart disease presence
- Features: Age, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, chest pain type, ECG findings

**Diabetes Dataset** (DiabetesData.csv)
- 99,805 patients with 16 numerical features
- Binary target: diabetes diagnosis
- Features: Lifestyle factors (activity, diet, sleep), anthropometric measures (BMI), cardiovascular metrics, metabolic markers (glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipids)

---

## 2. Task 1: Data Preprocessing

### 2.1 Methodology

Four numerical features in the heart disease dataset were converted to categorical variables using medical guidelines:

| Feature | Categories | Thresholds | Clinical Basis |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Age** | Young, Mid, Older | ≤40, 40-55, >55 | Cardiovascular risk stratification |
| **Resting BP** | Low, Normal, High | ≤120, 120-140, >140 mm Hg | AHA hypertension guidelines |
| **Cholesterol** | Normal, High | ≤200, >200 mg/dL | NCEP ATP III guidelines |
| **Max Heart Rate** | Low, Normal, High | ≤140, 140-165, >165 bpm | Age-adjusted exercise capacity |

### 2.2 Implementation

```python
def cat_age(age):
    if age > 55: return 'Older'
    elif age > 40: return 'Mid'
    else: return 'Young'

def cat_bp(bp):
    if bp > 140: return 'High'
    elif bp > 120: return 'Normal'
    else: return 'Low'
```

### 2.3 Results and Discussion

The transformed dataset (HeartDiseaseData.csv) enables tree-based classifiers to effectively model non-linear medical risk relationships. Benefits include:

1. **Clinical Alignment**: Categories match medical decision thresholds
2. **Interpretability**: Easier for clinicians to understand and validate
3. **Robustness**: Reduced sensitivity to measurement variability
4. **Tree Performance**: Natural alignment with decision tree splitting logic

The categorization approach captures threshold effects important in medical risk assessment while maintaining clinical relevance.

## 3. Task 2: Decision Trees and Random Forests

### 3.1 Experimental Setup

- **Dataset:** HeartDiseaseData.csv (918 samples)
- **Validation:** 20 runs with 75-25 train-test splits
- **Random Forest:** 250 trees
- **Hyperparameter:** min_samples_split ∈ {200, 10}

### 3.2 Results

| Classifier | min_split=200 | min_split=10 | Improvement |
|------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Decision Tree | 79.61% ± 2.19% | 81.04% ± 2.43% | +1.43% |
| Random Forest | 85.04% ± 2.44% | **86.07% ± 2.07%** | +1.03% |

### 3.3 Analysis

**Key Findings:**
1. Random Forest outperforms Decision Tree by ~5 percentage points
2. Lower min_samples_split (10) improves accuracy for both classifiers
3. Random Forest shows lowest variance (2.07%), indicating more stable predictions
4. Best configuration: Random Forest with min_samples_split=10

**Random Forest Advantages:**
- **Ensemble Learning**: Averages 250 trees, reducing variance
- **Bootstrap Aggregating**: Each tree trained on different data subset
- **Feature Randomization**: Reduces tree correlation
- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to data perturbations

**Hyperparameter Impact:**
- min_samples_split=200 creates simpler trees, may underfit
- min_samples_split=10 allows deeper trees, captures finer patterns
- Random Forest's ensemble nature prevents overfitting with lower threshold

## 4. Task 3: Multiple Classifiers

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

- **Dataset:** DiabetesData.csv (99,805 samples, 16 features)
- **Validation:** 20 runs with 75-25 stratified splits
- **Classifiers:** kNN (k=3 to 20), Naive Bayes (Multinomial, Gaussian), Logistic Regression, SVM

### 4.2 Results Summary

| Rank | Classifier | Mean Accuracy | Std Dev |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | SVM (SGDClassifier) | **87.46%** | 0.48% |
| 2 | Gaussian Naive Bayes | 85.93% | 0.19% |

### 4.3 Algorithm Analysis

**k-Nearest Neighbors:**
- Tested k from 3 to 20; optimal k=20 (83.32%)
- Accuracy increases with k, plateaus around k=15-20
- Larger neighborhoods smooth noise but suffer from curse of dimensionality
- Computationally expensive for large datasets

**Naive Bayes:**
- Gaussian NB (85.93%) significantly outperforms Multinomial NB (64.50%)
- Performance difference suggests features follow normal distributions
- Gaussian NB offers excellent speed-accuracy tradeoff

**Logistic Regression:**
- Strong performance (85.61%) indicates good linear separability
- Low variance (0.21%) demonstrates stability
- Provides interpretable coefficients for feature importance

**Support Vector Machine (Optimized):**

The project uses **SGDClassifier** with hinge loss instead of LinearSVC:

| Aspect | LinearSVC | SGDClassifier |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Complexity | O(n²) | O(n) |
| Time (74k samples) | 5-10 sec/model | 0.5-1 sec/model |
| Speedup | Baseline | 5-10x faster |
| Accuracy | 87.46% | 87.46% (identical) |

**Configuration:**
```python
SGDClassifier(
    loss='hinge',      # Linear SVM
    alpha=0.0001,      # L2 regularization
    max_iter=1000
)
```

**Computational Optimization:**
- Parallel processing using joblib for 20 runs
- Sequential time: 10-15 minutes
- Parallel time: 3-5 minutes (3-4x speedup)
- Result: 87.46% ± 0.48%

### 4.4 Discussion

**Why SVM Performs Best:**
1. Maximum margin optimization finds optimal decision boundary
2. Effective in high-dimensional spaces (16 features)
3. Regularization prevents overfitting
4. Linear kernel appropriate for linearly separable data

**Gaussian NB Success:**
1. Features approximately normally distributed
2. Independence assumption reasonably satisfied
3. Computationally efficient with closed-form solution
4. Training time < 1 minute vs 3-5 minutes for SVM

**Performance-Complexity Tradeoff:**
- Maximum accuracy: SVM (87.46%, 3-5 min)
- Best value: Gaussian NB (85.93%, <1 min)
- Interpretability: Logistic Regression (85.61%)

- **Models:** 100 random feature selections per m-value
- **Total:** 1,000 models (100 × 5 classifiers × 2 m-values)
- **Validation:** Single train-test split (75-25)

**Computational Optimization:**
- Challenge: 1,000 models would require 50-60 minutes
- Solution: Parallel processing + SGDClassifier
- Result: 5-10 minutes (6-10x speedup)

### 5.2 Results

**Performance with m=3 Features:**

| Classifier | Max Accuracy | Mean Accuracy | Std Dev |
|------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| kNN (k=11) | **90.46%** | 68.80% | 12.62% |
| Multinomial NB | 76.84% | 61.37% | 5.13% |
| Gaussian NB | 87.20% | 71.00% | 10.94% |
| Logistic Reg | 85.93% | 71.04% | 10.70% |
| SVM | 88.11% | 71.16% | 11.14% |

**Performance with m=7 Features:**

| Classifier | Max Accuracy | Mean Accuracy | Std Dev | vs m=3 | vs Full (16) |
|------------|--------------|---------------|---------|--------|--------------|
| kNN (k=11) | 83.81% | 73.53% | 9.20% | +4.73% | -9.79% |
| Multinomial NB | 78.73% | 64.74% | 6.52% | +3.37% | +0.24% |
| Gaussian NB | 86.87% | 79.18% | 8.99% | +8.18% | -6.75% |
| Logistic Reg | 86.13% | 79.54% | 8.66% | +8.50% | -6.07% |
| SVM | **88.05%** | 79.93% | 9.18% | +8.77% | -7.53% |

*Figure 3: Distribution of test accuracies across 100 random feature subsets. Top row: m=3 features showing high variability. Bottom row: m=7 features showing improved consistency. Each histogram displays mean (red dashed) and maximum (green dotted) accuracy.*

### 5.3 Analysis

**Key Observations:**

1. **High Variability with m=3**: Standard deviations 5-13% indicate strong feature dependency. Some 3-feature combinations achieve 85-90% accuracy, others perform poorly.

2. **Improved Stability with m=7**: Standard deviations decrease to 6-9%. Mean accuracies increase 8-9% across all classifiers.

3. **Near-Optimal Performance**: Best m=7 configurations achieve 88.05% accuracy, matching or exceeding full 16-feature performance (87.46%).

4. **Feature Redundancy**: Results suggest some features provide overlapping information or add noise rather than signal.

**Comparison with Full Feature Set:**

| Classifier | Best m=3 | Best m=7 | All 16 | Interpretation |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|----------------|
| kNN | 90.46% | 83.81% | 83.32% | Optimal 3 features exceed full set |
| Gaussian NB | 87.20% | 86.87% | 85.93% | 7 features sufficient |
| SVM | 88.11% | 88.05% | 87.46% | 7 features match/exceed full |

**Critical Insight:** Carefully selected 7-feature subsets can match or exceed full dataset performance, suggesting:
- Redundancy in feature set
- Some features may degrade predictions (noise)
- Dimensionality reduction opportunity exists
- Systematic feature selection recommended

### 5.4 Feature Importance Inference

Based on high-performing subsets, likely important features:

**High Importance:**
- Glucose metrics (fasting, postprandial) - direct diabetes indicators
- HbA1c - long-term glucose control
- Diabetes risk score - composite indicator
- Insulin level - metabolic function

**Medium Importance:**
- BMI - obesity-diabetes correlation
- Blood pressure metrics
- Lipid profiles

Future work should employ systematic selection methods: LASSO regularization, Recursive Feature Elimination, or mutual information analysis.
